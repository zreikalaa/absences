# absences
Web application that set the attendance of a course and many other features.

I made this website to help professors of my university - Lebanese university - to save the student's absences more easily.

with this website the professor has the ability to choose one of the courses that will appear automatically after specifying the major , the year and finally the section (Fr, En) . so after he chooses, all the students of this course will show up with checkboxes to get the absences .

the professor can also display all the absences [not just for the current year] for a specifique class Or for just a specific student in a period of time.

And with my website, any professor can Create a new Year for any major By entering the Students for Both sections and the Courses.

Languages Used: Php , CSS , DOM
And the Records are saved in XML files.

Very happy to achieve this project, and very excited to add much more functionalities to it.
